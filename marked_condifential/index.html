    <p>Here I am going to make another paragraph and practice making strong tags. <strong>This is a strong tag.</strong> This is very important to make something more important. Likewise we can use <em>em to emphasize things in italics which also works similarly</em>.</p>

    <!-- <em> stands for emphasis which makes my text italic -->
    <!-- <strong> makes my text bold -->
    <p><strong>Awesome TV shows</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><em>OVERLORD</em></li>

    <p><strong><em>TV shows I want to watch</em></strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>House of Dragons</strong> (Maybe Isai will share his HBO max with me) </li>
            <li>Isai is probably thinking, maybe Victor will share his Crunchyroll with me.. </li>
            <li>Looks like our Egos are going to destroy eachother.. </li>
            <li>I shall share the Crunchyroll first, surprise biatch!!</li>
            <li>Andrew and Chase, I will share with y'all as well ofcourse. Maybe we should all have one subscription each and share with eachother? Food for thought. </li>
